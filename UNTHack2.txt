Idea pitch
    - Web app
    - Desktop Toggl? No longer necessarily a Web app, but with all bells and whistles
    - Added feature: graphs over several weeks (overall time, or based on a project)
    - Easier graphing features for past months or years

Decided upon another project: 'WhoKnows'
    - NLP/ IR
    - scrape/ crawl UNT
    - keyword based queries for now; may make it natural language later; and finally domain specific
    - results: the Webpages of experts on a given topic
    - user feedback
    - use that to re-weight features over time 

Heuristics for finding personal pages - 
    - ~ in the name of the page 
    - get an index somehow

Building a search engine

Inverted Index
key(word) -> person1, person2, ..., personN

Auxiliary map from person to number to handle multiple people

Data store

Feature generation and machine learning 
    - person to person_code mapper
    - person to word, word to person - both types of matrices
    - V dimensional vectors, the features would just be words (lowercased and stemmed)
    - TF IDF, cosine similarity
    - input format - JSON? Database?
        [ name: {}, profile_data: {}, dept: {}, profile_pic_link: {} ]
    - output format - JSON? Database?
