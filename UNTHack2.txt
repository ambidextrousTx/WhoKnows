Idea pitch
    - Web app
    - Desktop Toggl? No longer necessarily a Web app, but with all bells and whistles
    - Added feature: graphs over several weeks (overall time, or based on a project)
    - Easier graphing features for past months or years

Decided upon another project: 'WhoKnows'
    - NLP/ IR
    - scrape/ crawl UNT
    - keyword based queries for now; may make it natural language later; and finally domain specific
    - results: the Webpages of experts on a given topic
